Bank Statement Usability improvements
=====================================

Usability improvements when using account_voucher in combination with bank_statement processing:

    * Generate & maintain accounting moves from within a bank statement on a line by line basis. 
    * Replace the "green/red ball" button by the "arrow" and "delete" buttons.
    * Bank statement line buttons : the green arrow creates/opens Voucher or Move, the Delete button removes draft Vouchers or Moves.
    * For AR/AP general accounts the account_voucher object is used for reconciliation, for other accounts a regular move is created.
    * When no partner has been entered on the bank statement line a search view is presented to find and select matching AR/AP transactions without a partner filter.
    * An intermediate selection screen is presented in case of multiple outstanding invoices. This screen is pre-filled with the matching line(s). 
    * The reconciled amount is shown on the bank statement line. An exclamation mark indicates differences between the paid amount and the open transactions.
    * The possibility to delete a Bank Statement with associated Posted Vouchers or Moves has been disabled.
    * Tax Codes and Tax Base Amounts can be added to the generated Accounting Moves in order to facilitate the encoding of bank costs.
    * The Bank Statement Confirm behaviour has been changed: at Confirm time a Posted Move will be created for Bank Statement Lines with no or Draft Moves.
    * Accounting Entry Changes are blocked for Moves linked to a Confirmed Bank Statement. 
    * The creation of Payment Voucher on Confirmed Bank Statements is not allowed.
    * Otherwise 'orphaned' Voucher Lines are removed when the associated Accounting Entry Line is deleted.
    * Remove Vouchers created from an invoice (e.g. via invoice 'Payment' button) when the invoice is cancelled.
    * Remove Vouchers created from a bank statement line when the Voucher reference is removed from the bank statement line.
    * Generate Voucher number and Move name from bank statement number and line.
    * Update Partner records with Bank Account Number information during reconciliation (including BBAN->IBAN conversion).
